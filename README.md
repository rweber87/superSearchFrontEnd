# Super Search

A new way to take notes on subjects that you want to know more about. With the search form hitting multiple APIs, you have access to a brief description provided by Wikipedia, videos from youtube, and photos from flickr. Clicking the note icon in the search form will bring out notes that you can save, which will be saved with association to the search term.
